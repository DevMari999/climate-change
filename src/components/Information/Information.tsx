                    <p>
                        Since the late 1800s, Earth's average yearly surface temperature has risen about 1째C, leading to
                        significant environmental changes. These include more extreme weather, reduced ice and snow, and
                        shifts in species habitats. Land is warming faster than oceans, with the Arctic heating up the
                        quickest. In 2022, global temperatures were 0.86째C above the 20th-century average, marking it
                        the sixth warmest year. All top 10 warmest years have occurred since 2010. If carbon emissions
                        persist, temperatures could soar between 2.8 to 5.7째C by century's end, emphasizing the need for
                        quick action to lower emissions and adopt greener energy.

                    <p>Recent studies show that sea turtles may not adapt their nesting habits enough to combat rising
                        sea temperatures. The research, covering 58 global nesting sites and all seven marine turtle
                        species, found that laying eggs earlier would offset only about 55% of a 1.5째C temperature rise.
                        Hotter nests yield more females and lower hatching success, raising extinction risks.

                    <p>Deforestation accelerates climate change by cutting down carbon-absorbing forests and emitting

                        disastrous setback in the reproduction of the species, which is heavily dependent on sea ice for
                        its existence. Present studies suggest that the loss of sea ice could lead to the extinction of
                        more than 90% of the emperor penguin population by century's end.

                        almost 60% of this.

                <p>And last but not least, we humans are not at all immune to the impact of climate change. If we don't
                    act urgently to mitigate climate change, we're looking at a potential one billion premature deaths
                    over the next century. This is based on the "1,000-ton rule," which estimates that for every 1,000
                    tons of fossil carbon burned, one future premature death is likely. This translates into a grave
                    human cost, especially for poorer countries that contribute far less to carbon emissions but bear a
                    disproportionate share of the impacts. To avoid this devastating outcome, immediate action is
                    required in the form of carbon emission reductions, transitioning to renewable energy, and
                    implementing technologies for carbon waste management. Financial incentives like carbon taxes could
                    also accelerate these crucial changes.</p>
